### What it is
Qunity is a Unity package for importing Quake maps made with Trenchbroom etc.
The package also comes with a Quake WAD importer to remove the need for extracting textures.

### Why is it experimental
Qunity is in a pretty early stage and is in active development. But the base functionality should work as expected.
Please file an issue if you run into problems. :-)

### How to install:

you can install it via Unity's [package manager via gitURL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html):
